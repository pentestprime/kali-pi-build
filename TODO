- [X] Add Re4son kernel (https://re4son-kernel.com/re4son-pi-kernel/) to the install process in system.sh
(No need, Re4son is already part of Kali...)
- [ ] Add interactive menu for polish (possibly using whiptail in place of dialog)
- [ ] Properly determine the starting sector of root before fdisk, as changes to this on OffSec's part WILL totally break things
